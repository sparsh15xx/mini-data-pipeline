# Challenges Faced

- Setting up Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase was tricky at first, but adding the right insert and select policies for the public role solved the issue.
- I had to make sure the Gemini model name was correct to avoid errors when calling the API.
- Debugging data type issues in Pandas took some trial and error.
- Using Gemini instead of OpenAI helped avoid quota and payment issues.
- Breaking the work into clear scripts made troubleshooting and testing much easier.
